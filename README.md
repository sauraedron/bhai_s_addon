Frequently a .blend file is used by multiple artists, this addon enables them to save viewport layers as well as render layers.
for e.g. a lighting artist may need layer 4 and 14 to work with.So he/she can select those layers and press the save button, now if he/she forgets which layers to activate, he can bring them back by clicking reset button. Note that viewport layers and renderlayers are both synched.
